## Make an antenna

Let's get hands-on with electronics! Your first step will be to connect your **l**ight-**e**mitting **d**iode (LED) to some jumper wires and a resistor.

+ Add another jumper wire to the other end of the resistor.

+ Take another jumper wire and slot one end onto the short leg of the LED.

You should end up with something that looks like this:
