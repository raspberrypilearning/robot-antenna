## Introduction
In this resource you will build a cardboard robot with a real flashing LED antenna, and use Scratch to create a robot twin that beeps.

### What you will make
Here is an example of the robot we made:

#### Hardware

* A Raspberry Pi and associated peripherals
* 1× LED
* 1× resistor (any resistor above 100 ohms will be fine)
* 4× female-to-female jumper lead
* A mini speaker or headphones

#### Software

You will need the latest version of Raspbian, which already includes Scratch 2.

**Note:** Scratch 2 will **only** work on the Raspberry Pi 2 and 3; it will not work on earlier models or on the Raspberry Pi Zero.

### Additional craft materials

+ Cardboard toilet roll
+ One sheet of A4 paper
+ Sharp pencil
+ Pens, crayons, and other decorating materials
+ Glue or tape
+ Small blob of modelling clay (e.g. plasticine or Blu Tack)
+ Scissors
