## What you will need

### Hardware

* 1 x LED
* 1 x 330 ohm resistor
* 4 x Female-to-female jumper leads

### Software

If you are running Raspbian Wheezy you'll need the latest version of Scratch (with GPIO support). To install open a Terminal and type:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install nuscratch
```

Raspbian Jessie includes this version of scratch and so no action is needed.
