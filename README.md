## Requirements

### Hardware

As well as a Raspberry Pi and the usual peripherals you'll also need:

- 1 x LED
- 1 x 220 ohm resistor
- 4 x Female-to-female jumper wires

### Software

If you are running Raspbian Wheezy you'll need:

- The Latest version of Scratch (with GPIO support)
 
If you are running Raspbian Jessie then The latest version of scratch is included.


An SD card loaded with Raspbian Jessie will not require any additional software.
